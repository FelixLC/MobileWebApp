### GUIDELINES

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, do not bundle more than one "feature" or bug fix per PR. Doing so makes it very hard to accept it if one of the fixes has issues.

It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

### STYLE

Always use two spaces, no tabs. This goes for any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.

### LICENSE 

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the MIT license.
